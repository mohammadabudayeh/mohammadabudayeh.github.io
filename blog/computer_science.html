                                <p>
                                    Computer science,  the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer science includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information processes, and artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics and engineering and therefore incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and electronic circuit design. Computer science also makes heavy use of hypothesis testing and experimentation during the conceptualization, design, measurement, and refinement of new algorithms, information structures, and computer architectures.
                                </p>
                                <h2>History of Computer science</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The history of computer science began long before our modern discipline of computer science, usually appearing in forms like mathematics or physics. Developments in previous centuries alluded to the discipline that we now know as computer science.This progression, from mechanical inventions and mathematical theories towards modern computer concepts and machines, led to the development of a major academic field, massive technological advancement across the Western world, and the basis of a massive worldwide trade and culture.
                                	<br>
                                	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Schickard" title="Wilhelm Schickard">Wilhelm Schickard</a> designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623. In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner. Leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, for, among other reasons, documenting the binary number system.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Development of Computer science</h2>

                                	Computer science emerged as an independent discipline in the early <span class="text-danger">1960s</span>, although the electronic digital computer that is the object of its study was invented some two decades earlier. The roots of computer science lie primarily in the related fields of mathematics, electrical engineering, physics, and management information systems.

                                    Computer scientists, including database admnistrators, network architects and computer systems analysts, typically work 40 hour weeks in comfortable offices, but sometimes they work nights and weekends to resolve technical problems or meet deadlines. Telecommuting has enabled computer scientists to increase productivity, but for security reasons, some work must be done at the office.
